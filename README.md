# MoviDates

This app is a mashup between Tinder and Meetup.com! Have you ever wanted to go see a movie, but didn't have anyone to go see it with? Users can search movies via OMDB api, add and remove them to their account, and search for nearby users who want to see the same movie.

TODO List:
  * View Profiles
  * Account Settings

Known Issues:
  * Distance bug (Due to a reason as of yet unknown, users are not always matched even if their distance is within the specified range)
